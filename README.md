# HR Attrition Analysis & Prediction

## People Analytics | Machine Learning Classification
---
## Introduction

Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations, impacting productivity, hiring costs, and overall business performance. This project analyzes an HR dataset to uncover key drivers of employee attrition and builds a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the organization.

## Purpose of the Analysis

**The objectives of this project are to:**

- Understand patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition
- Identify key employee attributes linked to higher attrition rates
- Build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict attrition
- Provide actionable, data-driven recommendations for HR decision-making

## Dataset Overview

**The dataset contains employee-level HR information, including:**

- Demographics (e.g., age, gender)
- Job-related features (department, role, job level)
- Compensation and benefits
- Work conditions and satisfaction indicators
- Attrition status (target variable)
  
**The target variable Attrition indicates whether an employee left the company (Yes) or stayed (No).**

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
**Key preprocessing steps included:**

- Checking and handling missing values
- Removing duplicate records
-Encoding categorical variables (including the target vector) using Label Encoding
- Separating features and target variable
- Scaling numerical features where required
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

These steps ensured the data was suitable for both analysis and machine learning modeling.
